# Hanami::Mailer notes

##CLI
 only HTML, only plaintext? choose?
--skip-plaintext, --skip-html


## Testing
Generate better spec, one for HTML and one for plaintext (so people don't need
to look up how to do that)

Should also have to, subject and from tests? even if not provided, as example?

## Namespace

Should it be Mailers?
- I think it should be Bookshelf::Mailers?
not sure how this interacts with `apps` architecture
